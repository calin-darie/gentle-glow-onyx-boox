# Gentle Glow for Onyx BOOX

Adds a quick settings tile ðŸ’¡ to turn the frontlight on or off on Onyx BOOX E-readers running Android 9+. 

When you turn on the light using this new quick settings tile, you can set warmth and brightness independently, instead of having to manually combine warm brightness with cold brightness.

This is like the evolution of faucets: first you have separate faucets for hot and cold water, then the interaction metaphor became navigating a 2D space where horizontal movement controls temperature and vertical movement controls flow, then you went to thermostatic faucets where you explicitly set temperature on one side and flow on the other. 
This is the thermostatic faucet for your frontlight!
