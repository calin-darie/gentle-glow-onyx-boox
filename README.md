Control your Onyx BOOX frontlight üí° with presets, custom configs and scheduling ‚è∞.

Look for the included quick settings tile.

Pro tip: setup a floating navigation ball button to launch the Gentle Glow, to always have it at your fingertips, including on the lock screen.

## How it works

Go to the quick settings and tap the Gentle Glow tile to toggle between light on and light off.

You can also long press the tile to get a dialog where you can choose the desired warmth and brightness.

Alternatively, set Gentle Glow as a floating navigation ball button to always have it at your fingertips. Since v4.x have a light switch inside the dialog, so you never have pull down quick settings for this if you don't want to.

In the main dialog, you get to choose between four configurations. 
Initially, you get these presets:
* Night, to be used in a dark bedroom.
* Dawn, to be used at first daylight, before sunrise
* Day, to be used at day time indoors or in the shade
* Sunset 

You can easily adjust the brightness or warmth on any of the four configurations. Just play with the sliders or with the fine tune buttons to the left and right of the sliders, and your changes are auto-saved.

Should you use the frontlight under any completely different circumstance, say on the subway, you can easily rename any of these configurations to Subway and fine tune the warmth and brightness to your daily commute needs.

At any time, you can go back to any of the presets.

You get a ‚úî Saved message each time your changes are auto-saved. A dialog pops up when you choose to replace the current configuration with a preset." src="screenshots/warmth-brightness-editable-options.png" width = "320px"/>

‚ö†Ô∏èWith Gentle Glow, you have finer control over the frontlight than with the native sliders. Native controls may show unexpected settings while Gentle Glow is in charge. Don't panic. You can always revert to the last known good system setting from the three vertical dots (kebab) menu in Gentle Glow.

The Onyx Slider / Other configuration is a good way to get your system sliders back to a known good state, see the warning above.

### Scheduling

Once you're happy with the light configurations, you can have them rotate on a schedule ‚è∞.

For example, you can schedule the light to turn to your Sunset config at 17:30, then to your Night config at 21:00, then off in the morning at 9:00.

While the schedule is on, you may still change the frontlight manually, and the configuration will last until the next scheduled change.
