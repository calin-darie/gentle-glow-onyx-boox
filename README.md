# Gentle Glow for Onyx BOOX

Adds a quick settings tile üí° to turn the frontlight on or off on Onyx BOOX E-readers running Android 9+. 

When you long tap this new quick settings tile, you can set warmth and brightness independently, instead of having to manually combine warm brightness with cold brightness.

This is like the evolution of faucets: first you have separate faucets for hot and cold water, then the interaction metaphor became navigating a 2D space where horizontal movement controls temperature and vertical movement controls flow, then you went to thermostatic faucets where you explicitly set temperature on one side and flow on the other. 
This is the thermostatic faucet for your frontlight!

You can also long press the tile to get a dialog where you can choose the desired warmth and brightness.

‚ö†Ô∏èWith this app, you have finer control over the frontlight than with the native sliders. Most of the time, the native controls will show the lights are toggled on, but the cold / warm sliders will stay at zero, because the setting is not one of their fixed increments.

The new approach for the controls may take a bit of time to grow on you, but think larger than Onyx: 
* Think of Android night mode, iOS Night Shift, Windows Night light or the old f.lux. In all these systems, display brightness remains a separate setting from night light warmth. 
* Think color pickers where you choose hue separately from brightness and RGB disks are just a feature for developers.
* Think thermostatic faucets!

In the warmth & brightness dialog, you get to choose between three configurations. 
Initially, you get three presets:
* Night, to be used in a dark bedroom.
* Dawn, to be used at first daylight, before sunrise
* Day, to be used at day time indoors or in the shade

You can easily adjust the brightness or warmth on any of the three configurations. Just play with the sliders or with the fine tune buttons to the left and right of the sliders, and your changes are auto-saved.

Should you use the frontlight under any completely different circumstance, say on the subway, you can easily rename any of these three configurations to Subway and fine tune the warmth and brightness to your daily commute needs.
At any time, you can go back to any of the presets.

<img alt="Brightness / Warmth configurations are editable: you can adjust warmth and/or brightness and rename the current configuration. You get a ‚úî Saved message each time your changes are auto-saved. A dialog pops up when you choose to replace the current configuration with a preset." src="screenshots/warmth-brightness-editable-options.png" width = "320px"/>

The Onyx Slider configuration is there just so changing the frontlight settings via the system sliders doesn't silently change your current configuration. 

The Onyx Slider configuration is also a good way to get your system sliders back to a known good state, see the warning above.
